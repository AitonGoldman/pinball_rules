# Finals Scoring 
- On score tie, play one ball tiebreaker game on the same machine, or machine selecte by td
- If no machine selected, TD selects
- Highest seed chooses set of machines (or next highest in group)
- Player can not choose same set again in all of finals
- Only one group max can wait for set of machines
- In case of signifigant tie, TD chooses game to play tiebreaker from other set

# Minor Malfunction
- does not cause loss of ball
- no advantage
- repeated occurence could be considered a major

# Major
- loss of ball
- Loss of Tilt warnings, without loss of ball, not a major
- 3 minutes to reproduce flipper malfunction
- if machine needs to be reset, record scores and reset
- if no reset needed, give player extra ball
- if award is given based on ball, player can request that ball on compensation ball (i.e. mist multiball)
- two or more majors means machine is disabled
- Majors may be declined by the player.  needs tournament official, and no unfair advantage.

# Known Malfunction
- duh

# Catastrophic Malfunction
- A catastrophic malfunction is any event, not caused by a player, which immediately ends play for all players on the machine.
- No attempt will be made to estimate scores, or reestablish state, at any time.

# Bene Malfunction
- Allow "should have ended ball" bene once a game
- If playfield is valid and ball pops into shooter lane after draining -  it goes back in the drain 
- If bene gives signifigant advantage score will be voided and player gets new game - UNLESS all players and TD can agree on adjustment

# Stuck Balls 1
- timed feature expiring during stuck ball is pinball - deal with it 
- wait for 3 automated searches
- TD can tap/nudge - TD is not responsible if ball drains, but Tilt means major malfunction 
- On TD opening machines, stuck ball can be placed in the plunger lane or on the upraised flipper of the tournament directors choosing,
- Multiple balls stuck - all placed on the flipper(s) of the tournament director’s choice or in the plunger lane if the flippers are inactive while the machine is open.
- if TD drains while machine is open then it's a major
- Can't open the machine/Opening or closing machine ends game?  Catastrophic malfunction. 

# Stuck Balls 2
- Lose some (but not all) balls during multi-ball is minor
- Stuck ball during multiball must be addressed
- Ball can be trapped if it can be released through player action (not shaking or bumping)
- Can't trap ball intentionally (i.e. on feature not controller by player) during multiball - you get a warning, or get a 0
- intentional causing ball search not allowed
- If ball is below outlane post it is not a stuck ball.  Player can free it themselves or have TD place ball directly in drain
- balls resting on apron are same as balls resting in outlane

# Stuck Balls 3
- Balls at rest on top of center post, inlane/outlane post, or insert divot directly above outlane are not stuck balls.  Player can try to free ball, or ask TD to put ball in drain (for center post) or in outlane (for inlane/outlane)
- If there is a auto kickback, manually trigger kickback and place ball on a flipper or other suitable location.
- If the ball is stuck on any playfield element that is located between the flippers, the ball will be considered a stuck ball if there is no chance of a drain from the ball rolling off of its resting place.
- "Dirty Pool" is allowed if the software accounts for it

# Disabled machine
- In the event that any players completed their game before the machine became disabled, and their finishing position on that game has been determined, that finishing position will stand and that player will not participate on the substitute machine. 

# Player Error
- A player error is any player action, purposeful or accidental, which affects the normal play or outcome of a game in progress.
- tilt-through is a 0, unless TD determines it's a machine problem
- if player tilts and next player gets warning, no penalty for first offense - second offense counts as a tilt through
- slam tilt is 0 for player, catastrophic for all other players
- 0 for the game if the foot is moved out of the pinbutt - TD will move game back into pinbutt 
- Any player who deliberately interferes with the play of another player, through distraction, touching the machine or player, or disrupting tournament procedures, will receive a score of zero for the game.

# Player Error 2
- Loss of ball through interference is a major
- Incorrect number of players, void game, with no penalty to any player.
- Can not add players to game once player 1 has plunged ball
- A player who plays out of turn in a multiplayer game will receive a score of zero. The affected player may choose to take over the ball in play, if possible, or he or she may choose to have the incident treated as a major malfunction. In the event the player takes over, he or she shall be deemed “in control” after declaring his or her intent, taking his or her position at the table, and making contact with the ball via the flippers. 
- If a player does get disqualified from a game, their position in the game is considered open. Any interference caused by player error (for example, tilt throughs or accidentally playing out of turn) in that position will have no additional consequences to the offending player. Any activity played in that open position will be considered void.

# Player Error 3
- For certain tournament machines, only players 1 and 3 will be used to help prevent tilt throughs. If a player accidentally does play in position 2 or 4, anything that occurs within that ball is considered void, with no penalty to any player.
- No coaching
- No camera or visual aid of any kind, other than the instructions provided by the machine, while standing at the machine.
- Applying physical force to a machine in order to derive a benefit from the activation of a switch, stuck ball, or other other scoring feature shall only be permitted if the benefit cannot be repeated continuously as determined by a tournament director. 
- No player may delay their game for more than 30 seconds, except to await a ruling or resolution of an environmental inconvenience. 

# Misc
- Any player who reaches the maximum possible score on a machine that has such, will receive that score as their total.
- Any player whose machine “rolls over” to a zero score is responsible for immediately advising the scorekeeper, both when this is imminent, as well as when it happens.
- On the game NBA Fastbreak using basketball-style scoring, each championship ring collected by the player shall cause their recorded score to be increased by 100 points.
- For EM score reel errors - No ruling will be made unless the score reel in question is the highest, or next-to-highest value reel. 
- If a player verbally concedes for any reason, the concession will only be considered valid if it is witnessed by a scorekeeper, tournament director, or all members of a group.

# Playing a session
- Any player who is more than 10 minutes late for their group will be removed from the session, and will automatically receive a 0-12 record for the session.
- If a player who was present initially cannot be found during the play of a group, tournament officials must be notified promptly. That player will be allowed no more than 3 minutes to return. If he or she does not return, each ball for that player will be promptly plunged and left unplayed.
