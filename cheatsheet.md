# Questions
* tie breaking if "meaningless" : "random tiebreak process" - does this mean coin flip?
* I don't think the rules actually say what happens during a tilt through to the tilted through player
* pinburgh rules for beneficial malfunction are confusing - specifically "If the beneficial malfunction has significantly increased the score of any player(s), the malfunction will be treated as a major malfunction, and each affected player will be given the same choice as described in “Major Malfunctions”
* can't intentionally cause ball search - result??

# Tiebreaking
* bye or bubble : single game
* "meaningless" : "random tiebreak process"

# Finals
* 30 minute warmup
* scoring : 4,2,1,0 OR 4,2,1
* highest seed chooses machine/order, moves down the list
* players can defer choosing machine/order ), choice moves to next player
* if eveyone defers, officials choose
* cant replay machine in same round
* top two players in each group advance
* signifigant ties decided by single game, chosen by the high seed
  * same rules wrt dibs by higher seeded groups
* Players may ask scorekeeper to start games

# Delays
* 30 seconds - unless env inconvience (expected resolved quickly)
* 3 minutes to "return to machine" after game starts
* 10 minutes to make it to start of session

# Stuck Balls
* TD has discretion to wait 4 ball searches
* TD has discretion to nudge ball
* Ball in non-auto shooter lane considered stuck

# Intentional Ball Trap
* Legal if trap can be released by player action (i.e not nudge/shake)

# Player gets a 0
* take advantage of bene malfunction
* Stuck ball during multi-ball : warning and/or 0?
* Can't intentionally cause ball search - player gets 0?
* Use feature to trap ball : warning and/or 0? 
* Tilt through 
  * TD can rule otherwise based on machine history
* Slam tilt/treated as catastrophic
* Deliberate tilt/slam tilt to gain advantage
* moving game off its rubber feet
  * td tries to get machine back in feet, tilt-through treated as normal til-through
* out of order player
  * original player can opt to take over 
  * needs to decalre they want to take control
  * original player can take "major malfunction"
  * score played by out of turn player is kept

# Restart Game
* catastrophic failure 
* beneficial malfunction is discovered and repaired
  * player's current score is voided and that player starts a new game
  * ...unless all players/TD agree on suitable adjustment
* machine is borked and can't be opened
* unintentional interference
* Wrong number of players
  * can't add players once player 1 has plunged, can't play single player game


# Nothing Happens
* Players plays player 2/4 on a game where players player 1/3
* No loss of ball/No signifigant benefit (minor)
* if minors are posted on machine
* player looses some balls during multiball
* first time machine gives you ball back unexpectadly
  * except for ball going straight from trough to shooter
  * improper ball save, ball comes to rest on kickback 
* Dirty Pool ( if it is recognized by the game ) is legal

# Player gets an extra ball in a new game
* multiple minors occur, could be considered a major
* loss of ball (not during multiball) when not design of the game
* flipper failure
  * td spends 3 minutes trying to recreate the problem  
* ball lost during td trying to get stuck ball unstuck
  * TD nudge with stuck ball
* unintentional interference

# Dealing with Major/Catastrophic
* player can decline major malfunction compensation
  * if it doesn't give an advantage to do so
* player gets new ball in new game (if possible)
  * player is allowed to ask to play ball 3 or 5
  * player can ask on machines that give awards automatically on those balls 
  * examples : (i.e. double bonus on EMs, mist multiball on drac)
* if continuing play is impossible, it is a catastrophic
  * record scores if possible
  * start new game
  * players play appropriate number of balls 
  * in progress balls from the old game can be replayed
  * add old scores to new

# Ball moved to flipper/plunger
* Non-multiball stuck ball
  * goes on flipper or shooter (td discretion) or other feature if none of that works
* Multiball stuck ball
  * goes on single flipper ( or shooter if it can't go on flippers )
* Stuck balls that would have hit a kickback
  * Kickback is trigerred and ball is considered a stuck ball
  * Does NOT include manually triggered kickback devices
* Stuck ball during multiball
  * Player must make effort to "gain control"
  * Alert TD

# Immediate Drain
* Drain not registered/ball goes to shooter lane
* Ball that comes to rest in an outlane
  * player can try to free it
  * td can instant drain
* Balls stuck on center post, inlane/outlane posts
  * Player can try to free it
  * TD can instant drain
  * During multiball, get control/call over TD to drain
