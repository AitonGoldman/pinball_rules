# Questions
* prize section ( for papa  - needs to be updated? )
* tie breaking if "meaningless" : "random tiebreak process" - does this mean coin flip?
* I don't think the rules actually say what happens during a tilt through to the tilted through player
* pinburgh rules for beneficial malfunction are confusing - specifically "If the beneficial malfunction has significantly increased the score of any player(s), the malfunction will be treated as a major malfunction, and each affected player will be given the same choice as described in “Major Malfunctions”
* can't intentionally cause ball search - result??

# Tiebreaking
* tie breaking if for bye or bubble : single game
* tie breaking if "meaningless" : "random tiebreak process" - does this mean coin flip?

# Finals
* 30 minute warmup - players must inform officials about problems at this point
* scoring : 4,2,1,0 OR 4,2,1
* highest seed chooses machine or order, and moves down the list
* players can defer to make a choice ( don't choose machine or order ), and the choice moves to the next player
* if no player makes a choice, then officials choose (randomly or however they want)
* machines already chosen in this round can't be chosen, and you can't pick the same machine in the same round
* top two players in each group advance
* final round machines will be the same machines from previous final rounds (unless officials decide not to)
* ties in final rounds (that are signifigant) - single game, chosen by the high seed - same rules wrt dibs by higher seeded groups

# Player Errors
* Player action that affects a game (on purpose or not)
* In finals, players may ask scorekeeper to start games

# Delays
* 30 seconds - unless env inconvience (reasonably expected to be resolved quickly)
* 3 minutes to "return to machine" after game starts
* 10 minutes to make it to start of session

# Stuck Balls
* TD has discretion to wait 4 ball searches
* TD has discretion to nudge ball
* Ball in non-auto plunger shooter lane is considered stuck
* Stuck balls natural path on being freed will lead to hitting a kickback -  kickback is trigerred and ball is considered a stuck ball
** does NOT include manually triggered kickback devices
* stuck ball during multiball, player must make effort to "gain control" and alert TD
* can't intentionally cause ball search - ??

# Intentional Ball Trap
* Player can trap balls if it is a trap that can be released by player action (i.e not nudge/shake)

# Player gets a 0
* Player taking advantage of stuck ball during multi-ball : warning and/or 0?
* Player taking advantage of feature to trap ball : warning and/or 0? 
* tilt through gets you 0 (unless TD rules otherwise based on machine behaivor)
* Slam tilt gives player 0 and treated as catastrophic failure
* Deliberate tilt or slam tilt to gain advantage gains a 0
* moving game off its rubber feet - player gets 0
** td tries to get machine back in feet, tilt-through treated as normal til-through
* out of order player - player gets 0
** original player can opt to take over (needs to decalre they want to take control) or take "major malfunction" - score played by out of turn player is kept

# Restart Game
* catastrophic failure 
* beneficial malfunction is discovered and repaired, player's current score is voided and that player starts a new game
* machine is borked and can't be opened
* unintentional interference
* Wrong number of players
** can't add players once player 1 has plunged, can't play single player game


# Nothing Happens
* No loss of ball/No signifigant benefit (minor)
* if minors are posted on machine
* player looses balls during multiball, but still has at least one ball (minor)
* first time machine gives you ball back unexpectadly, it's allowed (except for ball going straight from trough to shooter)
** improper ball save, ball comes to rest on kickback 
* Dirty Pool ( as long as it is recognized by the game ) is legal

# Player gets an extra ball in a new game
* multiple minors occur, it could be considered a major
* loss of ball (not during multiball) when it's not by design of the game
* flipper failure ( td spends 3 minutes trying to recreate the problem ) 
* ball lost during td trying to get stuck ball unstuck or TD nudge with stuck ball
* unintentional interference

# Dealing with Major/Catastrophic
* player can decline major malfunction compensation if it doesn't give an advantage to do so
* if possible, player gets new ball in new game
** player is allowed to ask to play ball 3 or 5 on machines that give awards automatically on those balls (i.e. double bonus on EMs, mist multiball on drac)
* if continuing play is impossible, record scores if possible, start new game, and players play appropriate number of balls (in progress balls from the old game can be replayed) and add old scores to new

# Ball moved to flipper/plunger
* Non-multiball stuck ball - goes on flipper or shooter (td discretion) or other feature if none of that works
* Multiball stuck ball - goes on single flipper ( or shooter if it can't go on flippers )


# Immediate Drain
* Ball goes through trough to shooter lane without registering loss of ball
* Ball that comes to rest in an outlane - player can try to free it, or instant drain
* Balls stuck on center post, inlane/outlane posts - TD must be called over to place it in the drain
** If this happens during multiball, immediately get remaining balls under control and call over TD to drain
